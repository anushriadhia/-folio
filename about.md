Hi, my name is Anushri and I'm a software engineer. I recently graduated from UNC Chapel Hill with a B.S. in computer science. I generally enjoy learning and have wanted a way to keep track of what I'm learning about for a while now. This blog will probably focus on various topics within tech but you might find a post here or there about design, art, or books I'm reading. If you believe you've found a mistake in one of my posts, please reach out!
